            <h1>My Journey</h1>
            <p>
                My journey has been one of passion, growth, and continuous learning. From the early days of exploring programming concepts to becoming a skilled software engineer, each step has shaped who I am today. I started with curiosity and a drive to solve problems, which led me to master languages like JavaScript, Python, and frameworks such as Angular and Node.js.
                Building projects like **Academeet**, an ecosystem designed to empower students through connection and success, reflects my commitment to creating impactful solutions. Using modern technologies like Angular, Tailwind CSS, NestJS, and PostgreSQL, I am turning ideas into reality while constantly expanding my technical expertise.
                Beyond coding, my journey is about embracing challenges, collaborating with others, and striving for excellence. Every bug fixed, every feature implemented, and every new skill acquired is a step toward my goal: to make a meaningful difference through technology.
